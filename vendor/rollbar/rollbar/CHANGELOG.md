# Changelog

## 0.11.0

New features:

- Added support for nested exceptions. See [#51](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/51)

Possible breaking changes:

- Calling report_exception with a non-exception will result in the data being dropped and a message being logged to the Rollbar logger, instead of an empty message being reported
- Exceptions are now sent as trace_chain, not trace, so any Custom Grouping Rules in the Rollbar UI will need to be updated to use `body.trace_chain.*.` in place of `body.trace.`

## 0.10.0

New features:

- `report_exception` now accepts args for `extra_data` and `payload_data`, providing full access to the Rollbar API. See [#47](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/47)
- Fix a json_encode warning with utf8 request param keys. See [#42](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/42)

## 0.5.4

- Fix E_WARNING when scrubbing a param that is an array


## 0.5.3

- Error handler function (`report_php_error`) now always returns false, so that the default php error handler still runs. This is a breaking change if your code relied on the old behavior where the error handler did *not* ever halt script execution.
